## 👋 For Your Information
I uploaded this project using this project myself, starting from making repository in the github, the name of repository, description even commit done automatically by this program. this really saves my time 85%

## 📋 Overview

This automation tool simplifies the process of creating GitHub repositories and pushing your local projects to GitHub. It leverages local LLM capabilities through Ollama to generate intelligent project names and descriptions, saving you time and effort.

## ✨ Features

- 🤖 **AI-Generated Content**: Uses Ollama's local LLM to generate project names and descriptions
- 🔄 **Automatic Repository Creation**: Creates GitHub repositories with appropriate visibility settings
- 📦 **Git Initialization**: Handles git init, commits, and pushes automatically
- 🌐 **Browser Integration**: Option to open the newly created repository in your web browser

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Git installed and configured
- GitHub account with personal access token
- Ollama installed with at least one model (I recommend you to install mistral or openchat only because I also use it too)

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Make sure Ollama is running with your desired model

## ⚙️ Configuration

Before running the script, update the following variables in the code:

```python
GITHUB_USERNAME = "your-github-username"
GITHUB_TOKEN = "your-github-personal-access-token"
PROJECT_PATH = "/path/to/your/project"
OLLAMA_MODEL = "openchat:latest"  # or any other Ollama model you have installed
```

## 🚀 Usage

1. Navigate to your project directory
2. Run the script:
   ```
   main.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to enter project information
4. The script will create a repository and push your project

## 🔮 Planned Features
### What features will I add to my program next?

- 📝 **README Template Generation**: AI-powered creation of complete README files based on project content
- 🚫 **Ignore File**: will ignore files that are not needed
- 🛣️ **Effective path**: Insert the path through the terminal
- 🕹️ **Manual Input**: You will be able to choose to use Chatbot or not to create a name and description
- 🔔 **Notification**: will be heard when needing input from the user and after the upload is complete
- 🔄 **Repeat execution**: if the program experiences malfunction, you can choose to repeat the program or manual input
- 🔒 **Enhanced Security**: Better token management and secure authentication
